This Arduino sketch controls 4 PWM outputs to which 4 LED strips, or an RGB plus a separate W strip, or one RGBW strip, can be connected via 4 FET modules.

Five RGBW presets are defined inside the code. Five inputs are used to switch to any of these five presets.

The sketch also holds a sequencer via which a day / evening / night / morning cycle can be created, for instance for a model railroad layout. This sequencer is switched via a sixth input. The time for each phase as well as the time to fade between phases is defined in the code.
